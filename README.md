## Important information

### Datasets
[datasets](/datasets/) contains ```.csv``` files from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ysc4224-2023-final-project/data). 

**NOTE**: ```prices.csv``` and ```train.csv``` are >100mb each, so they are not included in the repo. Please download from  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ysc4224-2023-final-project/data) separately and place them in [datasets](/datasets/) so that they can be imported without file path error. For convenience, please don't change the file directory for the .csv files.

### Dependencies
Install dependencies using ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in your command line. If you use new packages not already included in [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt), make sure to update [requirements.txt](/requirements.txt).
